Feature Engineering and Data Preprocessing

Project Overview

This repository contains the feature engineering and data preprocessing code for [Feature Engineering]. The goal is to transform raw data into meaningful features, handle missing values, and prepare the data for modeling.


Data Sources

- Raw Data: [titanic.csv]

Feature Engineering

- Techniques Used:
    - Handling categorical variables: [one-hot encoding, label encoding]
    - Scaling/Normalizing: [StandardScaler, MinMaxScaler]
    - Feature extraction: [PCA, t-SNE]

Data Preprocessing

- Steps Taken:
    - Handling missing values: [imputation, interpolation]
    - Data normalization: [StandardScaler, MinMaxScaler]
    - Feature selection: [correlation analysis, recursive feature elimination]


Usage

1. Clone the repository
2. Install required libraries
3. use preprocessed data and engineered features for modeling
